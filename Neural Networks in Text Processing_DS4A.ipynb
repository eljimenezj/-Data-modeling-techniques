    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Context.** You are a data scientist working for a machine learning consultancy. One of your clients wants to be able to classify text reviews automatically by the likely rating (on a 1 - 5 scale) that that person would give. However, they do not have sufficient data they generated on their own to do this, so you need to use an external, rich dataset as a basis on which to build your model and then translate it over.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** Your task is to **build a neural networks-based model for classifying text reviews into likely ratings (on a 1 - 5 scale)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** We'll use the Amazon review dataset again and try to classify reviews into star ratings automatically. Instead of just positive and negative, we'll take on the harder challenge of predicting the *exact* star rating. The lowest score is 1 and the highest is 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of trying to optimize by pre-processing the text, we'll do very basic tokenization and experiment with different neural network models, architectures, and hyperparameters to optimize the results. You'll start by building a simple dense neural network and try to get it to perform better using various techniques. Then you'll evaluate the results and diagnose where it tends to perform more poorly."

    "## Experimenting with different regularization strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways to mitigate overfitting in a neural network, collectively known as *regularization* techniques. One common regularization technique is called [Dropout](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dropout). In this regularization method, a set of neurons is randomly selected at each training step to be completely ignored. This is done so that the neurons in our network do not rely strongly on their neighboring neurons and we avoid the creation of [\"co-adaptations\"](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a/srivastava14a.pdf) that do not generalize well to unseen data. This making the model more robust and less prone to overffiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create dropouts in `keras` by adding a layer named `Dropout(p)`, where `p` is the probability of dropping neurons in the previous layer. For example, the following model would implement dropout by removing roughly 20% percent of the outputs of the embedding layer at each training step:"

A more straightforward way to prevent overfitting is simply by adding more training data.
